1. Background Information on the FSEL field

1.1. StrataSwitch

The IRULE and GIRULE entries are kept in sorted order.  Each rule entry
has a 3-bit FSEL field, which points to one of the 8 possible masks.

Because the filter rules are kept in sorted order, and the FSEL field is
the most significant field in the sort key, it happens that all rule
entries with a given FSEL are grouped together.

The filter processor searches the entire rules table eight times, once
per mask.  A rule can match only if its FSEL field equals the mask
number being searched.

1.2. Draco

The speed of FFP lookups became a bottleneck due to greater packet rates
and greater number of masks to search.

Noting that all rules corresponding to the same mask (FSEL value) are
grouped together, the solution is to search only the group of rules
corresponding to the mask being searched.

To implement this, each mask was augmented with a RULES_START and
RULES_COUNT field denoting the beginning and size of the group of rules
corresponding to the mask.  It is software's responsibility to keep
RULES_START and RULES_COUNT up to date during insert and delete
operations.

The software computes and caches the RULES_START and RULES_COUNT values
internally for all chips.  This is done even for StrataSwitch where the
performance of software inserts, deletes, and lookups benefits greatly.

Note that the existence of RULES_START and RULES_COUNT actually makes
the FSEL field redundant.  However, on Draco it is still referenced by
the hardware and all of the rules must be in sorted order.

1.3. Tucana

To save die space on Tucana, the FSEL field is not referenced nor is it
implemented in the rules memory.  The rules table does not even need to
be fully sorted; only blocks of rules corresponding to a given mask must
be contiguous and sorted.

2. Software Utilization of the FSEL field

Software commonly passes around rule table entries which contain the
FSEL field.  Various routines look at the FSEL field in order to know
which mask the rule belongs to.

The absence of the FSEL field would mean rewriting a huge amount of
software from the ground up: sorted memory insert, delete, and lookup
routines, entry allocation, binary searches, filter rule allocations and
management, the entire BCM filter API implementation, and all
diagnostics commands that allow writing, dumping, and otherwise
manipulating filter entries.

We have avoided this for Tucana using a very simple approach comprising
the following:

2.1. FSEL is still in the regsfile

The FSEL field remains in the register file even though it is not
implemented in the hardware.  Its existence in the register file implies
its existence in rules entries that are passed around in the software.
Also, while the FSEL field is written and read in the S-Channel
operation it is not implemented in the hardware so it will not be stored
persistently.

2.2. FSEL is implemented in software

In the lowest level memory access routines, soc_mem_read and
soc_mem_write, software caches the value of the FSEL field for each rule
entry.  On write, FSEL is saved in a cache in the soc_control structure,
and on read, FSEL is overwritten into the entry after it is read from
the hardware.

2.3. No other software is aware of this

None of soc_mem_insert, soc_mem_delete, soc_mem_lookup, or other higher
level routine is aware that the FSEL field is being emulated.  Therefore
the rules table is maintained exactly as it was on StrataSwitch and
Draco and all higher level code is shared with these chips.  This
includes the memory read/write diagnostics.

3. Ingress Port Direction Vector

A filter rule in StrataSwitch and Draco may be qualified to match only a
single ingress port by means of the IPORT field in the rules entry.
However, Tucana supports qualifying a filter to match on any subset of
ingress ports.

3.1. Hardware Implementation

The IPORT field is replaced by an IPORT_BITMAP field.  However, a little
consideration reveals that the implementation is not straightforward.  A
difficulty arises when multiple rules are inserted that differ only by
IPORT_BITMAP.  These rules will be grouped together in the rules table,
but there is actually no way the hardware can complete its binary search
to find which of these entries' bitmaps contains the packet ingress
port.

The solution to this is to add a second port bitmap called
IPORT_DIRECTION to each rule.

A "group" is a bunch of entries with the same key and different port
bitmaps.  These will be next to each other in the table.  The
IPORT_DIRECTION field is referred to as the "direction vector."

Assuming the hardware has matched the rest of the key and is looking for
a source port match:

    (1) If the port's bit in IPORT_BITMAP is set, the search
        is complete and successful.

    (2) Else check the port's bit in the IPORT_DIRECTION vector.

        If the direction bit is 0, the binary search continues downward
        in the table toward lower-numbered entries.

        If the direction bit is 1, the binary search continues upward in
        the table toward higher-numbered entries.

3.2. Software Conventions

It is the responsibility of software to maintain the the IPORT_DIRECTION
bits during all insert and delete operations such that they are always
consistent and correct.

Some software conventions are adopted to:

    (1) Keep the table consistent all during the course of update

    (2) Minimize the amount of ancillary state that must be maintained

    (3) Minimize the amount of shuffling of entries required for inserts
        and deletes.

3.2.1. Adding an entry to the table.

    (1) When an entry is added to a group, it is always added at the end
        of the group.

    (2) The direction vector for a new entry is the OR of the port
        bitmaps of existing entries in the same group.

    (3) The direction vectors of existing entries do not need to be
        altered when an entry is added to a group.

3.2.2. Deleting an entry from the table

Note: the table should be locked until both steps have been completed.

    (1) When an entry is deleted from the group, later entries are
        shifted down to fill in the table.  The table will still be
        consistent. (Searches for those ports in the removed entry will
        fail.)

    (2) When deleting an entry, the direction vectors of the group's
        remaining entries must have the bits of the removed entry's port
        bitmap cleared.  This only needs to happen to entries in the
        group following the deleted entry.

3.2.3. Programming requirements (in addition to the above)

    (1) The source port bitmaps for different entries in a group must
        not overlap.

3.3. Software Implementation

The soc_mem_insert, soc_mem_delete, and soc_mem_lookup routines are
aware of the software conventions.  Higher software layers need not be
concerned with the details.
